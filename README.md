    A multilingual personal page with about, blog, projects, contact and curriculum sections.

This is my personal [website][me]. I'm using [Hugo][hugo] to generate the static
files and the theme is [introduction][introduction] based.

We can use [Discussions Tab][discussions] space to networking and start
conversations. Think of this area like a way for you to suggest things to me, to
exchange an idea, and even build something together! Feel free to show me
something you did.
