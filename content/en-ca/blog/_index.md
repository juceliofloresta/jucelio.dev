## Welcome

Here you will find regular, informal publications on programming language,
computer science, distributed systems, gameplay and science fiction readings. To

All publications are my own, duly referenced, and should not be associated with
my personal or professional activities. The association with companies or
organizations will be explicitly mentioned in the publication, as well as the
partnership with other authors.

You can use the [series][series] to check the continuity of a publication, or
