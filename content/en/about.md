When I was a [Computer Science graduate][univali-cc] I was able to work with
academic research in the field of [Computer Vision][4visionlab], and in [Digital
Identity Management][gidlab]. The Laboratory's partnerships with
[companies][audaces] and [government institutions][rnp] made the results of the
research accessible to industry and government.

At [Cheesecake Labs][cheesecakelabs], where I had the opportunity to work with
[several people][singularity-university] from all over the world, the process of
creating projects with these clients was incredible. It is very gratifying to
see and feel the result of your work in the world. I currently have the
opportunity to transform the Brazilian Payments Market, making the offer of
financial services to tenants fairer, supporting each one of them in their
entrepreneurial journey. So Iâ€™m at [stone][stone][<sup>co.</sup>][stoneco]
acting as Software Engineer.

As a personal project, I have the challenge of making Competitive Programming
more widespread, and breaking prejudices about the area, including thinking of
the need for some kind of genius to solve problems, I intend to do this through
the [Competitive Code][codigo-competitivo], creating content on the subject.
